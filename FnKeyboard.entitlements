         This provides maximum protection against:
         - DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES code injection
         - Unsigned executable memory
         - Debugging by non-root processes

         Accessibility permission (required for CGEvent tap and HID event posting)
         is granted at runtime via System Settings → Privacy & Security. -->
